We can't believe it's been two months since
[Dart Frog moved to a new organization](/blog/future-of-dart-frog)!

Here's a quick recap of what the team has been up to:

- Migrated and redesigned the [**Dart Frog Website**](https://dart-frog.dev)
- Migrated the
  [**VSCode Extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DartFrog.dart-frog-dev)
- Released [**package:dart_frog_lint**](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_frog_lint)
- Added support for
  [**Pub Workspaces**](https://github.com/dart-frog-dev/dart_frog/pull/1825)
- Contributed benchmarks to
  [**TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks**](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/pull/10048)
- Created a new [**Discord Server**](https://dart-frog.dev/discord)
- Published
  [**14 package releases to pub.dev**](https://pub.dev/publishers/dart-frog.dev/packages)
- Closed over
  [**20 pull requests**](https://github.com/dart-frog-dev/dart_frog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)

## üåê Meet [dart-frog.dev](https://dart-frog.dev)

One of the first things we worked on was migrating the official website and
documentation to an independent domain. The site is now powered by
[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) and includes a refreshed design, full
text search, updated documentation, a new blog with an
[RSS Feed](/blog/rss.xml).

## üì¶ New Package: [`dart_frog_lint`](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_frog_lint)

While updating documentation and examples, we realized we could provide a much
better developer experience configuring lint rules.

We released the [`dart_frog_lint`](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_frog_lint)
package to standardize lint rules across all Dart Frog projects.

New projects created via `dart_frog create` now ship with `dart_frog_lint`
automatically.

Existing projects can add `dart_frog_lint` by following these steps:

1. Install `dart_frog_lint` as a dev dependency

```sh
dart pub add --dev dart_frog_lint
```

2. Use the recommended rules in the `analysis_options.yaml`

```yaml
include: package:dart_frog_lint/recommended.yaml
```

With over 8,400 downloads in the last 30 days, it's awesome to see the impact
`dart_frog_lint` is having already within the community!

## üéØ Pub Workspaces Support

A highly-anticipated feature was adding support for
[pub workspaces](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/workspaces). Since Dart 3.6.0, pub
supports organizing repositories into a workspace using a single shared
resolution for all packages. Using workspaces for large repositories reduces the
amount of memory required for analysis, hence improving performance.

As of
[Dart Frog CLI v1.2.9](https://github.com/dart-frog-dev/dart_frog/pull/1825),
Dart Frog fully supports pub workspaces! Dart Frog workspaces is already being
used in production at [Shorebird](https://shorebird.dev) to serve millions of
patches all over the world. If your team is using pub workspaces with Dart Frog,
[let us know](https://dart-frog.dev/discord) ‚Äî we'd love to hear about your
experience!

## üèéÔ∏è New Benchmarks

As part of burning down a variety of longstanding issues, we added basic
performance benchmarks to
[TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r23)
for both [Shelf](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/pull/10025)
and [Dart Frog](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/pull/10048).
This is just the first many benchmarks we plan to add in order to both measure
and improve the performance of Dart Frog servers.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Updated VSCode Extension

As part of the migration to a new GitHub organization, we also had to migrate
the Dart Frog VSCode extension. Since the VSCode marketplace does not support
transferring an existing extension to a different publisher, we have published a
new Dart Frog
[**VSCode Extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DartFrog.dart-frog-dev).
We are working on deprecating the old extension in order to provide a smooth,
seamless transition so stay tuned for additional updates over the coming days.

## üí¨ Dedicated Discord Server

Finally, Dart Frog now has an official
[Discord Server](https://dart-frog.dev/discord)! You can join the community, get
support from the team, show off you work and more! We're currently at 99 active
members so join us and help us continue to grow the community!

## üëÄ What's Next

While we've gotten a lot done over the last two months, there's still much to
look forward to!

Next, we'll focus on burning down the existing backlog of issues which includes
tackling some highly requested features such as:

- [API Documentation Generation](https://github.com/dart-frog-dev/dart_frog/issues/152)
- [Dart API Client Generation](https://github.com/dart-frog-dev/dart_frog/issues/151)
- [Logger Support](https://github.com/dart-frog-dev/dart_frog/issues/153)

If there's anything you feel is missing or can be improved, please
[let us know](https://github.com/dart-frog-dev/dart_frog/issues/new).

None of this would be possible without the community so thanks everyone for the
support and we'll see you in the next update! ‚úåÔ∏è
