An in-memory implementation of the TodosDataSource interface.

## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using In Memory Todos Data Source you must have the [Dart SDK][dart_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Add `in_memory_todos_data_source` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  in_memory_todos_data_source:
```

Install it:

```sh
dart pub get
```

## Continuous Integration ü§ñ

In Memory Todos Data Source comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Dart Frog Lint][dart_frog_lint_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit tests:

```sh
dart pub global activate coverage 1.2.0
dart test --coverage=coverage
dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
open coverage/index.html
```
